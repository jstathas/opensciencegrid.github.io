## The Open Science Grid

A national, distributed computing partnership for data-intensive research

<div id="osg-special-banner">
  <p class="special-banner-1"><strong>We are here to help with your <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21528/nsf21528.htm/">Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Proposal!</a> Please contact us at <a href="mailto:cc-star-proposals@opensciencegrid.org">cc-star-proposals@opensciencegrid.org</a></strong></p>
  <p class="special-banner-1" style="margin-bottom: 0.5ex;">
    We have significant experience working with CC* applicants and awardees, offering letters of support and consulting for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>bringing the power of the OSG to YOUR researchers</li>
    <li>
        gathering science drivers and planning local computing resources or
    </li>
    <li>CC*-required resource sharing for the Campus Compute category, and other options for integrating with OSG</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>The OSG facilitates access to distributed high throughput computing for research in the US.
    The resources accessible through the OSG are contributed by the community, organized by the OSG, and governed by the OSG consortium.
    In the last 12 months, we have provided more than 1.2 billion CPU hours to researchers across a wide variety of projects.
    </p>

  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h3>Submit Locally, Run Globally</h3>
    <p>Researchers can run jobs on OSG from their home institution or <a href="https://www.osgconnect.net/">OSG's centrally-operated submission service, OSG Connect</a> (available for US-based research and scholarship).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h3>Sharing Is Key</h3>
    <p><em>Sharing is a core principle of the OSG.</em>  Over 100 million CPU hours delivered on the OSG in the past year were opportunistic: they would have remained on but idle
if it wasn't for the OSG. Sharing allows individual researchers to access larger computing resources and large organizations to keep their utilization high.</p>

    <h3>Resource Providers</h3>
    <p>The Open Science Grid consists of computing and storage elements at over 100 individual sites spanning the United States.
    These sites, primarily at universities and national labs, range in size from a few hundred to tens of thousands of CPU cores.</p>

  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h3>The OSG Software Stack</h3>
    <p>The OSG provides an integrated software stack to enable high throughput computing; <a href="docs/">visit our technical documents website for information</a>.</p>

    <h3>Coordinating CI Services</h3>
    <p>
      NSFâ€™s
      <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cise/oac/vision/blueprint-2019/nsf-aci-blueprint-services.pdf">Blueprint
        for National Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Services</a>
      lays out the need for coordination services to bring together the distributed elements of a national CI ecosystem.
      It highlights OSG as providing distributed high throughput computing services to the U.S. research community.
